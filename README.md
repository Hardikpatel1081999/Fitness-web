# F2 Fitness Center Website

## Overview
This project is a website for F2 Fitness Center, designed to showcase the fitness center's services, success stories, and contact information. It was originally created in 2021 as a practice exercise to enhance design creativity and backend development skills. Please note that the website was not designed with responsiveness as a primary focus.

## Features
- **Home**: Provides an introduction to the fitness center along with a motivational message.
- **About Us**: Shares the history and mission of F2 Fitness Center.
- **Services**: Details the various fitness services offered by the center.
- **Success Stories**: Displays testimonials from satisfied clients.
- **Contact Us**: Includes the centerâ€™s contact information and an embedded Google map for easy location access.
- **User Account**: Modals for user login, signup, and password reset, integrated with Firebase for authentication.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **CSS** (Bootstrap for layout and custom styles)
- **JavaScript**
- **Firebase** (used for user authentication and database management)
- **jQuery**

## Current Limitations
- **Responsiveness**: The website was not initially designed to be responsive, which means it may not display optimally on various screen sizes, particularly on mobile devices.
- **Design**: The design was part of a practice exercise and may not align with contemporary design standards.
- **Backend**: The backend implementation was also a learning exercise, and might not adhere to current best practices in web development.
- **Third-Party Authentication**: Initially, the website included third-party login options via Facebook. However, due to recent policy updates from Firebase, the Facebook login integration is no longer functioning as intended. This may affect some features that relied on Facebook authentication.
- **Project Scope**: This project was developed to explore and showcase the skills I had in 2021, and may not reflect the full range of modern web development capabilities.

## Future Improvements
To enhance the website's functionality and user experience, the following improvements are planned:
1. **Implement Media Queries**: Incorporate CSS media queries to ensure the website layout adapts to different screen sizes.
2. **Responsive Navigation**: Develop a responsive dropdown menu to improve navigation on smaller screens.
3. **Element Resizing**: Adjust the sizing of images, text, and other elements to maintain proportionality across various devices.
4. **Update Authentication**: Explore alternative third-party login options or update Firebase settings to restore full authentication functionality.

## Getting Started
To view or modify the project locally:
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fitness-web.git
   ```
2. **Open the Website**: 
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to view the current state of the website.
3. **Modify the Styles**:
   - To implement the planned improvements, modify the `styleformini.css` file, or add new styles to make the site responsive.
